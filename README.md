SharpPong(Less than 300lines)
=========

Super simple pong game in C# using the standard console.

It is structured as anything is a GameElement, which simply can be updated and drawn, this reduces the code lot.

One troubling thing: If a player holds down a key, it will block the other player. If you got a solution to this please contact me!
